				<strong>Firearms in the Realms</strong>
			</p>
			<p>Firearms are becoming more and more widespread in Faerûn as Lantanese priests of Gond the Wondermaker are making and spreading them throughout the Realms.</p>
			<p>The Lantanese have mastered matchlock weapons-making, and can regularly produce high-quality matchlock pistols, matchlock arquebuses, matchlock calivers, and matchlock muskets (with gun rests). They can also produce hand match ribalds for armies, as well as matchlock blunderbusses. All Lantanese firearms are stamped with the mark of Gond on the butt or grip of the weapon.</p>
			<p>Very large, crude bombards are made and used by the Red Wizards of Thay, and some of these siege guns are in the Pirate Isles.</p>
			<p>One important development is that firearms are entering numerous worlds from sources in wildspace. Wheellock pistols known as “starwheels” are sometimes sold or traded across Toril by spelljammer crews, or they are stolen from crews by local thieves. The Lantanese were quick to copy the design of these "starwheels", and have started producing them "locally".</p>

		<description>
			<p>Gunpowder is chiefly used to propel a bullet out of the barrel of a pistol or rifle, or it is formed into a bomb. Gunpowder is sold in small wooden kegs and in waterresistant powder horns.</p>
			<p class="indent">Setting fire to a container full of gunpowder can cause it to explode, dealing fire damage to creatures within 10 feet of it (3d6 for a powder horn, 7d6 for a keg). A successful DC 12 Dexterity saving throw halves the damage. Setting fire to an ounce of gunpowder causes it to flare for 1 round, s hedding br ight light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an add itional 30 feet.</p>

A moderate wind (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses the smoke in 4 rounds; a strong wind (20 or more miles per hour) disperses it in 1 round.</p>

		<description>The smallest and most compact firearm, the pistol is also one of the rarest firearms, as most people not only prefer firearms with longer range, but the pistol itself requires greater craftsmanship to craft.

Despite its short range, a pistol is still a formidable weapon, and is often used as a self-defense weapon. Due to this, pistol grips often have metal butts that allow them to be used as effective clubs.</description>
